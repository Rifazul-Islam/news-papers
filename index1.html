                <b> 1. Var , Let, Const difference : </b>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while
                let
                and const
                are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be
                updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all
                hoisted to
                the top of their scope.

                <b> 2 . Array function VS Regular function : </b> this value inside a regular function is dynamic and
                depends on
                the
                invocation. But this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer
                function.
                arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the
                opposite, doesn't define arguments (but you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest
                parameter ...args).
                If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using
                the
                return keyword.

                <b> 3. Map,ForEach,Filter find :</b>map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array
                individually.
                filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong.The main difference between forEach
                and
                filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the
                callback
                and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the
                return
                value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.
